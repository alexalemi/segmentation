and de_gennes confinement in the pit ( rg > height > lp ) . such a large contrast is unfeasible for the coarse - grained model we use here . however , we see sufficient contrast to clearly illustrate the important factors driving the dynamics . our system is a channel with alternating segments of slits and pits ( fig . 1 ) . the slit has a square cross_section of size ly Ã— h = 4 . 9 Ïƒ Ã— 4 . 9 Ïƒ and the pit has a rectangular_cross_section ly Ã— lz , pit = 4 . 9 Ïƒ Ã— 25 . 6 Ïƒ ( this is the space available for the polymer with the monomer - wall interaction cutoff subtracted ) . the pit and slit lengths in the x direction are lx , pit = 27 . 6 Ïƒ and 69 . 3 Ïƒ , respectively . Ïƒ = 1 . 5 nm defines the length_scale in the 126 truncated and shifted lennard - jones_potential ( lj ) , ulj = 4  ( ( Ïƒ / r ) 12 âˆ’ ( Ïƒ / r ) 6 + 1 / 4 ) , where the energy scale is  = kbt and t = 300 k . the polymer is modeled by joining consecutive beads with a fene bond [ 22 ] with a maximum length of r0 = 1 . 5 Ïƒ and a spring_constant of k = 32 . 6  Ïƒ âˆ’ 2 . the excluded - volume effect is realized through ulj between all monomer pairs . the channel_walls are made out of ljBR= f âˆ— + a . lemma 2 . ( iii ) together_with assumption 3 . ( i ) leads to the conclusion that Â¯ x â‰¥ âˆ— 0 implies x â‰¥ âˆ— 0 but the converse need not be true . this complication is a special_feature of our model and , notwithstanding the mathematical_difficulties it involves , it highlights the role of discounting in determining the overall level of risk . the statement x â‰¥ âˆ— 0 , in fact , does_not_exclude losses but_rather that losses larger_than Î· are ignored , for any Î· or , yet in other_words , that losses may considered as arbitrarily_small . the statement Â¯ x â‰¥ âˆ— 0 means , on the other_hand , that losses from x may be hedged away by investing an_arbitrarily_small amount in the num_Â´_eraire asset . however , if the num_Â´_eraire asset does_not_guarantee a minimum payoff the arbitrarily_small losses associated_with Î¸ may require a potentially unbounded amount of the num_Â´_eraire asset in order to be hedged . the problem arises whenever losses occur jointly with a low value for x0 , as is often the case during financial_crises . we stress that the choice of the num_Â´_eraire has risk_management implications , a fact first noted by el - karoui and ravanelli [ 30 ] and central to their discussion of the cash additivity_property of risk_measures . the impact of random num Â´ eraires on risk_measures is also discussed in filipovic [ 33 ] . the symbol ba âˆ— ( resp . p âˆ— ) will henceforth denote the family of finitely_additive set functions m ( resp . probabilities ) defined on all subsets of Ï‰ and such that f âˆˆ l1 ( m ) and UNK fdm = 0 whenever f = âˆ— 0BRfollowing : + ( [ 0 , âˆ ) , { 0 } ) Ö’_â†’ diff âˆ + ( r ) , theorem 1 a trivial consequence of theorem 9 . every right - angled_artin_group embeds_into diff âˆ + ( [ 0 , âˆ ) , { 0 } ) . proof . immediate from lemmas 7 and 8 , as_well as the fact that diff âˆ + ( i , âˆ‚ i ) Ö’_â†’ diff âˆ + ( [ 0 , âˆ ) , { 0 } ) .
