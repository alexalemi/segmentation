( 4 . 18 ) the massless_limit of the ode ( 4 . 6 ) in terms of Ïˆ is obtained by first taking Â¯ z â†’ 0 with z finite and small , then taking the limit z âˆ¼ s â†’ 0 while Î¸ â†’ + âˆ . this process yields p ( x , e ) = xnm âˆ’ e , UNK ( âˆ’ 1 ) n + 1dn ( g ) + p ( x , e ) UNK Ïˆ ( x , e ) = 0 , where the operator dn ( g ) defined in ( 4 . 10 ) is now a function of x . this is precisely the nth - order ode appearing in the massless su ( n ) ode / im correspondence [ 6 , 7 ] . ( 4 . 19 ) similarly , sending the parameter z â†’ 0 in the ode for Â¯ Ïˆ ( 4 . 7 ) while_keeping Â¯ z small but finite , then taking the limit Â¯ z âˆ¼ s â†’ 0 as Î¸ â†’ âˆ’ âˆ we find UNK ( âˆ’ 1 ) n + 1dn ( g â€  ) + p ( Â¯ x , Â¯ e ) UNK Â¯ Ïˆ ( Â¯ x , Â¯ e ) = 0 , ( 4 . 20 ) with g â€ BR, ( 32 ) ( 33 ) where h Î» ( r ) = g Î» ( r ) âˆ’ 1 is the total correlation_function and h Î» ( k ) is its fourier_transform . the ornstein - zernike equation for the imaginary fluid in fourier_space is given by [ 4 ] , 9 using_similar_arguments given in the case of dsg Î» ( r ) d Î» s dsc Î» ( r ) d Î» s UNK UNK UNK UNK Î» = 0 h Î» ( k ) = c Î» ( k ) 1 âˆ’ Ï c Î» ( k ) , it can_be seen that ( 34 ) ( 35 ) UNK UNK UNK Î» = 0 âˆ Î² s thus from the above discussion , it can_be seen that , for the class of fluids with hardcore repulsion , apart_from the helmholtz_free_energy series , the taylor_series for c ( r ) and g ( r ) obtained by expanding around Î» = 0 also becomes power_series in Î² . as a result , if the coefficients of the series are obtained along one isotherm , then theBR1ts3 ï¿½ âˆ’ âˆ† xv3 + âˆ† pc3 âˆ’ 1r3 âˆ† f3 ï¿½ âˆ† ptie , 1 = 2 Ï€ t120 ( âˆ† f1 âˆ’ âˆ† f2 ) + 2 Ï€ t130 ( âˆ† f1 âˆ’ âˆ† f3 ) ( 22 ) âˆ† ptie , 2 = 2 Ï€ t210 ( âˆ† f2 âˆ’ âˆ† f1 ) + 2 Ï€ t230 ( âˆ† f2 âˆ’ âˆ† f3 ) ( 23 ) âˆ† ptie , 3 = 2 Ï€ t310 ( âˆ† f3 âˆ’ âˆ† f1 ) + 2 Ï€ t320 ( âˆ† f3 âˆ’ âˆ† f2 ) ( 24 ) ( 17 ) ( 18 ) ( 19 ) ( 20 ) ( 21 ) these can_be more compactly_written in matrix - vector form as , d u r c í µ_í°± = í µ_í°€ í µ_í°± + í µ_í° í µ_í²– + í µ_í°… í µ_í²… y wt 150 mi . pv pq loads ct pq loads figure 2 . optimal_controller configuration . figure 3 . three - area load - frequency control application .
