the equations above lead to accurate wavefunctions and energies , approaching their exact values asymptotically . as is well_known , the energy eigenvalues form bands with the number of bands being equal to the number of plane_waves used to solve the equations . however , because of the infinite number of coefficients involved , it is not possible to solve these equations in an exact manner . furthermore , setting up of eq . ( 5 ) 4 requires an_additional step of calculating the fourier_coefficients of the periodic_potential , which adds to the computational_effort needed to obtain the solutions . on the other_hand , if we are able_to integrate the schrodinger_equation to obtain solutions satisfying the bloch â€™_s condition , we will have the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues for the system described by eq . ( 1 ) . how it is to be done is the subject of this_paper . ii . solving the schrodinger_equation by integration in general the wavefunction is complex and can_be written in terms of its real and imaginary_components and , respectively ,BRassociated_with recent massive_star_formation ( 12 ) . galaxies at z âˆ¼ 0 . 5 - 1 , in which frbs were_discovered , have significant massive_star_formation and are expected to be rich in gas and dust , resulting in large dispersion measure . we also note_that short millisecond_radio burts with fluxes âˆ¼ 1 â€“ 4 jy from m31 have_recently_been reported ( 13 ) . some of these events , especially multiple bursts with similar dispersion measures , can_be connected with the repetitive activity of magnetars in m31 . candidates to hyperflares of magnetars in m31 have_already_been_reported ( 14 ) . in the present case not hyperflares , but weaker sgr bursts with luminosities l âˆ¼ 1039 â€“ 1040_erg_s âˆ’ 1 can_be responsible 2 for the observed radio_bursts , assuming the sgr burst energy scaling from ( 7 ) . the rate of bursts obtained in ( 13 ) is in agreement_with that of x / gamma - ray_bursts from magnetars with required luminosity assuming one sgr in m31 to be in active phase â€” a few events per_hour . such a rate was observed by ( 15 ) during the rxte monitoring of a galactic sgr during its active phase . x - ray ( or / and gamma - ray ) bursts with l âˆ¼ 1039 â€“ 1040_erg_s âˆ’ 1 by themselves can_be easily missed from m31 , because of their short_duration . despite potentially_detectable fluxes , the number of photons from âˆ¼ 0 . 1BRdrastic_changes in s ( k , Ï‰ ) arise when hy UNK = 0 for two_reasons : ( i ) at order 1 , quasicharges and quasifluxes interact , giving_rise_to the previously_discussed bound_states ; ( ii ) the effective observable generates quasifluxes at the same order . for sufficiently_large hy , an important part of the spectral_weight is carried_by some of these bound_states [ see fig . 2 ( lower_panel ) ] . in contrast to the dos , s ( k , Ï‰ ) clearly detects these states and keeps_track of them when they merge_into the continuum , leaving prominent resonances . note also that the dos is 4 fig . 3 .
