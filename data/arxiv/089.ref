( 2006 ) generalizes the adcc model into the agdcc model , where the parameters of the correlation equation are vectors , and not scalars . this allows for asset - specific correlation dynamics . in the agdcc model , the qt matrix in the 19 dcc model is replaced with : qt = s ( 1 âˆ’ Â¯ Îº 2 âˆ’ Â¯ Î» 2 âˆ’ Â¯ Î´ 2 / 2 ) + Îº Îº UNK UNK u UNK t âˆ’ 1ut âˆ’ 1 + Î» Î» UNK UNKBR- type chains another , while the interface that separates these two clusters contains the backbone monomers . we find that pearl - necklace or janus - like structures , which normally occur for bottle - brush polymers with rigid backbones under poor_solvent conditions , are fully attributed to the backbone rigidity , and , therefore , such structures are unlikely in the case of bottle brushes with fully flexible_backbones . also , a comparative discussion with earlier_work on the phase behaviour of single - component bottle - brush polymers with flexible_backbones is performed . 4 1 0 2 r p a 6 1 ] t f o s . t a m d n o c [ 1 v 9 5 1 4 . 4 0 4 1 : v i x r a pacs_numbers_:_02 . 70ns , 64 . 75 . jk , 82 . 35 . jk submitted to : materials_research express bottle - brush co - polymers with flexible_backbones under poor_solvent conditions 2 1 . introduction recent_advances in chemical_synthesis allow for the tinkering of macromolecules of complex architecture with well - defined properties , suitable for exquisite applications [ 1 , 2 ] . bottle - brush polymers are macromolecules with side_chains grafted_onto a backbone polymeric chain that can_be intrinsically rigid or moderately flexible due_to the presence of the side_chains [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ,BRih Ïˆ f , Ï† 1 , v ( t ) i , âˆ€ k â‰¥ 2 .
